# B-Tree-331
B+ Tree

This is the B+ tree project for 331

I will upload the previous projects final code here.
All the new code you guys work on must be done in a seperate branch.
Then when done merge with master and resolve conflicts.
Also dont forget to pull latest changes from master.

And dont add random files that arent part of the project, like temporary ide files
